## Plan
1. Briefly explain the concepts needed:
	- Competitive programming problem
	- Solving problems
	- Testing problems (and why we like it)
	- themis
1. Show a problem on themis, attract attention to example tests (at least 2 are needed)
1. Create test files and put in example tests from themis problem
1. Show that the other tests have already been prepared beforehand
1. Test using cats, gets WA
1. Fix simple previously introduced probelm, run test again, show success
1. Show that the solution has actually been submitted to themis


## Shopping list
- [ ] Suitable problem on themis
- [ ] All but one of the example tests already in files
- [ ] Solution with simple bug, preferably one that WAs only some of the example tests and not all
